== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= If I remove a widget can I get it back? =

Yes, you can uncheck hidden widgets to make them available again. Deactivating the plugin will make all widgets available again.

= Does this remove widgets from the sidebar? =

Yes and No. Yes, when a widget is hidden it will not be displayed in any sidebars. When a widget is hidden it is still part of the sidebar, so if you hide a widget then unhide it, it will still be in the sidebar. With that being said, once you've hidden a widget and you edit your sidebars, the widget will be removed from the sidebar as it was not in the sidebar when you saved it.
